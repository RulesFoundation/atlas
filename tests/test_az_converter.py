<p><font color=GREEN>42-5006</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Taxpayer bonds; out of state licensed contractors and manufactured building dealers</u></font></p>

<p>A. Notwithstanding section 42-1102, the department shall require a surety bond for each taxpayer who is required to be licensed under title 32, chapter 10 or who is regulated under title 41, chapter 37, article 3, if the taxpayer's principal place of business is outside this state or if the taxpayer has conducted business in this state for less than one year. The department shall prescribe the form of the bond. The bond shall be maintained for a period of at least two years.</p>

<p>B. The bond, duly executed by the applicant as principal and with a corporation duly authorized to execute and write bonds in this state as surety, shall be payable to this state and conditioned on the payment of all transaction privilege taxes incurred and imposed on the taxpayer by this state and its political subdivisions. The bond shall be in such amount, but not less than two thousand dollars, as will assure the payment of the transaction privilege taxes which may reasonably be expected to be incurred by the licensed establishment for a period of one hundred fifty days.</p>

<p>C. The director, by rule, may establish classes of expected tax liability in five thousand dollar increments, beginning with the minimum bond amount prescribed in subsection B of this section. The bond shall provide that after notice and a hearing the director may order forfeited to this state and any affected political subdivision part or all of the bond for nonpayment of taxes, interest and penalties.</p>

<p>D. A licensee on application for a new license covered by subsection A of this section, renewal of a license covered by subsection A of this section or transfer of a license covered by subsection A of this section is exempt from posting a bond if the licensee has for at least two years immediately preceding the application made timely payment of all transaction privilege taxes incurred.</p>

<p>E. If a licensee is not exempt from this section, the director may exempt the licensee if the director finds that the surety bond is not necessary to insure payment of such taxes to the state and any affected political subdivision or the licensee had good cause for the late or insufficient payment of the transaction privilege tax and affiliated excise taxes incurred. </p>
